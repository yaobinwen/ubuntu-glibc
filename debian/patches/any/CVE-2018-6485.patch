Subject: [PATCH] Fix integer overflows in internal memalign and malloc [BZ
 #22343] [BZ #22774]

When posix_memalign is called with an alignment less than MALLOC_ALIGNMENT
and a requested size close to SIZE_MAX, it falls back to malloc code
(because the alignment of a block returned by malloc is sufficient to
satisfy the call).  In this case, an integer overflow in _int_malloc leads
to posix_memalign incorrectly returning successfully.

Upon fixing this and writing a somewhat thorough regression test, it was
discovered that when posix_memalign is called with an alignment larger than
MALLOC_ALIGNMENT (so it uses _int_memalign instead) and a requested size
close to SIZE_MAX, a different integer overflow in _int_memalign leads to
posix_memalign incorrectly returning successfully.

Both integer overflows affect other memory allocation functions that use
_int_malloc (one affected malloc in x86) or _int_memalign as well.

This commit fixes both integer overflows.  In addition to this, it adds a
regression test to guard against false successful allocations by the
following memory allocation functions when called with too-large allocation
sizes and, where relevant, various valid alignments:
malloc, realloc, calloc, memalign, posix_memalign, aligned_alloc, valloc,
and pvalloc.

(cherry picked from commit 8e448310d74b283c5cd02b9ed7fb997b47bf9b22)
